# hello-world
Just another repository <&nbsp> 
Brandon here! I am looking to become a self starting web developer with the potential of going back to school. I spent a lot of my time 
switching majors and trying to figure out what I want to do and so far it hasnt worked out for me. I took a web design class at school and I loved it and did very well in the class. I learned CSS, HTML and Java Script
